## Project Description
This project involves the design of a two-stage operational amplifier at 180nm technology using the gm over Id methodology. The amplifier is designed to meet specifications such as Gain > 60dB, load capacitance Cl = 20fF, gain bandwidth product (GBW) = 1GHz, and Phase margin > 50 degrees.

## Table of Specifications

| Specification          | Value     |
|------------------------|-----------|
| Gain                   | > 60dB    |
| Load Capacitance (Cl)  | 20fF      |
| GBW                    | 1GHz      |

## Design Details

### Model and Methodology
- **Model File:** CMOS180nm
- **Design Methodology:** gm over Id methodology (Emphasis on optimized W/L ratio and Width/Length multiples of 0.18nm)

### Prerequisites
Before designing, the following steps were taken:
- Used Analog Designer Toolbox (ADT) for generating parameter charts using CMOS180.txt model file.
- ADT allows plotting various parameter charts for NMOS and PMOS devices, considering different specifications such as length, VDS, VSB, etc.

### Tools Used
- LTspice: Schematic and simulation purposes
- ADT (Analog Designer Toolbox): Generating lookup tables for CMOS 180nm and parameter charts for gm over Id methodology
- Electric Binary Software: Layout design

### Calculations for First Stage
- Gain = 40, CL = 20f, Rout = 93 KŒ©
- ùê∫ùëö/ùêºùëë = 0.43mS/12 = 35.83uA
- Various calculations for NMOS and PMOS.

### Calculations for Next Stage (Common Source using PMOS and Current Source Load)
- Gain = 28, CL = 20f
- Various calculations for PMOS and NMOS.
